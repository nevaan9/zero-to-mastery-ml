    "# Unstructured Data: Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always understand the PROCESS that Daniel goes through\n",
    "- This process will hold true to many projects to come\n",
    "\n",
    "link: https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/wip/section-4-unstructured-data-projects/end-to-end-dog-vision.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daniel did this project in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",
    "- This is because we can utilize googles powerful GPU's to run our ML models\n",
    "- HOWEVER\n",
    "    - There are limitations to Google Colab\n",
    "    - If it disconnects, all the files / variabled in your workspace will be deleted (one example)\n",
    "    - Read about it before diving in: \n",
    "        - https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "### Steps to follow for the project:\n",
    "1. Setting up env and getting data ready\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a google colab workspace\n",
    "- Connect tp google drive\n",
    "- Go to kaggle and upload kaggle dog breeds data to your google drive\n",
    "- Go to colab workspace and unzip the data in colab to live in google drive\n",
    "    - !unzip \"pathToZipFile\" -d \"pathToDestination\"\n",
    "- Go through project workflow and write down the steps (Problem def, data, evaluation, features etc)\n",
    "    - Same as the supervised learning problem workflow\n",
    "- Import tools\n",
    "    - Tensorflow (turn data into tensors) --make sure you have Tensorflow latest version!\n",
    "    - Google how to import tensor flow\n",
    "    - Pick a model from tensorflow hub\n",
    "        - Read up on what tensorflow hub is!\n",
    "    - Know how to load the latest version of Tensorflow in Colab (hint - use a magic function)\n",
    "        - google how to do this\n",
    "    - Use a GPU\n",
    "        - Know how get this into your colab workspace\n",
    "        - It's a matter of clicking on the UI and changing some runtime settings. Google how to do it.\n",
    "    - The google colab tutorials (on the site itself - its a colab notebook), is awesome! Floowing some and run the cells\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Loading and inspecting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the labels.cvs file and do some EDA\n",
    "    - How many breeds do we have\n",
    "    - How many images per breed to we have\n",
    "        - mean?\n",
    "        - median?\n",
    "            - We look at this because it's mportant to have AT LEAST 10 images per class, but the recommended amount is 100 for the ML model to do well: https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/docs/prepare\n",
    "- Load data into TENSORS\n",
    "- Know how to VIEW IMAGES in out jupyter notebook \n",
    "    - from Ipython.display import Image\n",
    "- Put all the filenames (with the path) into an array\n",
    "    - Make sure array size is the same as train dir number of files\n",
    "- Come up with a way to convert the breed names into numbers\n",
    "    - What Daniel did was get an array of all the unique breen names, and create an array of array of each breed where that breed occurs in the the unique breed names array. So if we had ['Lab', 'Dingo', 'Spaniel'] as the unique breeds, and the breeds we have are ['Lab', 'Lab', 'Spaniel', 'Dingo'], the result would be [[1,0,0], [1,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0]]\n",
    "    - Can we just convert the string name (make sure all are lowercase) into it's ascii number? Or even a hash? (Nevaan thought)\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Create validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is important because we cannot really train a deeping learning model initially on 10,000+ images. I mean we can but since ML is an iterative process, it would take a crazy amount of time to work on 10,000 in our initial iterations. So lets start with a small number (1000 maybe), if things seem to work well, then increase the training to larger numbers.\n",
    "- COOL TRICK IN COLAB - the @param setter. Look it up!\n",
    "- After you have decided on the small batch of data you will be working on, further split them into train test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preprocess Images\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you read the tensorflow docs\n",
    "    - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images\n",
    "    - https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data\n",
    "- Convert image (from it's path) to tnesors\n",
    "- NORMALIZE the image values (makes running ML models more efficient)\n",
    "- Resize all images into one size\n",
    "- Tensorflow likes things in BATCHES\n",
    "    - Google what this is\n",
    "    - Yaan lecun , jemery howard batch size\n",
    "    - Batching is basically taking a batch of images and calulating some stuff on those, and then moving on to the next batch. Yaan Lecun says we need to use 32 as the batch size, but we can explore which is the best for us.\n",
    "    - UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT THE TENSORFLOW BATCHES STUFF\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Understand Tensor Flowhub and all the other libraries similar to it\n",
    "    - These are essentially open source deep learning code we can leverage for our problems\n",
    "    - We do not need to re-invent the wheel\n",

    "    - Understand what is happening\n",
    "    - Then DIVE DEEPER BASED ON THE AREAS YOU THINK ARE INTERESTING!\n",
    "    - Just at first though, complete the project and try to understand what the project is doing -- in our case the dog vision project\n",
    "- HOMEWORK: Learn how to choose a model from Tensorflow hub\n",
    "    - What is an architecture?\n",
    "    - How do we know what published models are good vs bad? - is there a star system like npm?\n",

    "- UNDERSTAND HOW TO INTERPRET THE KERAS OUTPUT TYPE\n",
    "        \n",
    "7. Evaluating our model\n",
    "- Look into KERAS TENSORFLOW CUSTOM CALLBACKS\n",
    "    - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard\n",
    "    - Some example callbacks are TensorBoard (show progress of our model training) and Early Stopping Callback (prevent over fitting)\n",
    "- PREVENTING OVERFITTING (Early stopping callback)\n",
    "    - You dont wanna oveerfit (memorize), because it prevents our model from generalizing very well!\n",
    "- What is number of Epochs?\n",
    "    - Research!\n",
    "    - Essentially number of passes of the data we want to do\n",
    "- After training your model...\n",
    "    - QUESTION: What happens of the model is overfitting? (i.e the accuracy that the training dataset has is higher than the validation dataset.) - HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS?\n",
    "        - Note: Overfitting to begin with is a GOOD THING\n",
    "        - We can evaluate this with our tensorboard logs\n",
    "            - Know how to get the tensorboard dashboard up and running - PRETTY COOL FEATURE!\n",
    "            - Access the logs directory and visualize the contents\n",
    "        -  One way to prevent overfitting is by USING MORE DATA!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Making Predictions\n",
    "- Know what the model output shape is (we will usually name it predictions)\n",
    "- In Daniels example it was a 200 x 120 matrix\n",
    "    - This is because he passed 200 values to be predicted\n",
    "    - The prediction output returns all those 200 values with 120 values that add up to 1 (these are the prediction probabilites aka confidence intervals)\n",
    "        - why 120? Because we had 120 breeds that the prediction can be (unique_breeds array)\n",
    "        - So the prediction will be the highest probability in the returned 'prediction' array; The index where that highest probability is, will be the index where our prediction will be in unique_breeds array\n"

    "### Finishing Dog Vision: Where to next?\n",
    "Woah! What an effort. If you've made it this far, you've just gone end-to-end on a multi-class image classification problem. This is the same style of problem self-driving cars have, except with different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should be proud of yourself. Consider finishing this project a momentum builder for getting started with your next deep learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're looking for some ideas, you've got plenty of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could try to improve the full model we trained in this notebook in a few ways (there are a fair few options). Since our early experiment (using only 1000 images) hinted at our model overfitting (the results on the training set far outperformed the results on the validation set), one goal going forward would be to try and prevent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trying another model from TensorFlow Hub - Perhaps a different model would perform better on our dataset. One option would be to experiment with a different pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub or look into the tf.keras.applications module. (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data augmentation - Take the training images and manipulate (crop, resize) or distort them (flip, rotate) to create even more training data for the model to learn from. Check out the TensorFlow images documentation for a whole bunch of functions you can use on images. A great idea would be to try and replicate the techniques in this example cat vs. dog image classification notebook for our dog breeds problem. (https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/06/07/data_aug/), (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image), (https://github.com/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/pc/exercises/image_classification_part2.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tuning - The model we used in this notebook was directly from TensorFlow Hub, we took what it had already learned from another dataset (ImageNet) and applied it to our own. Another option is to use what the model already knows and fine-tune this knowledge to our own dataset (pictures of dogs). This would mean all of the patterns within the model would be updated to be more specific to pictures of dogs rather than general images.
